This project is related to an automatic vending machine using verilog.

STATES TRANSITION:-
                       The cost of the product is 15.

S0 : 0 Rs in Vending Machine – 
- If nothing added: Stay on State 0, OUTPUT = 0, CHANGE = 0. 
- If 5 Rs added: Move to State 1, OUTPUT = 0, CHANGE = 0. 
-If 10 Rs added: Move to State 2, OUTPUT = 0, CHANGE = 0.

S1 : 5 Rs in Vending Machine –

- If nothing added: Here, this means the vending machine waited some
time but no money was added signifying an incomplete transaction, thus the vending machine should return back the money added as
CHANGE (5 Rs). No bottle given. Move to State 0, OUTPUT = 0, CHANGE = Rs 5 (01). 
- If 5 Rs added: Move to State 2, OUTPUT = 0, CHANGE = 0. 
- If 10 Rs added: Adding 10 Rs means the vending machine now has
15 Rs total thus, a bottle will be returned with no CHANGE. Move to State 0, OUTPUT = 1, CHANGE = Rs 0. 

S2 : 10 Rs in Vending Machine – 

- If nothing added: Again, incomplete transaction thus vending machine returns the money added as CHANGE (10 Rs). No bottle
given. Move to State 0, OUTPUT = 0, CHANGE = Rs 10 (10). 
-If 5 Rs added: Signifies a complete transaction, a bottle is returned with no CHANGE. Move to State 0, OUTPUT = 1, CHANGE = Rs 0.
- If 10 Rs added: Here the customer over payed, thus a bottle should be
returned but with CHANGE(5 Rs). Move to State 0, OUTPUT = 1, CHANGE = Rs 5. Move to State 0, OUTPUT = 1, CHANGE = Rs 5 (01).
